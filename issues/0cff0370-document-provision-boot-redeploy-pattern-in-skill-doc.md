# Document provision.boot redeploy pattern in skill doc

**ID:** 0cff0370 | **Status:** Open | **Created:** 2026-02-24T20:41:12+01:00

The `[provision.boot]` section can be used to redeploy binaries on every boot (copy from mount, restart services), but this pattern isn't documented. Add an example to the skill doc's agent lifecycle section showing the redeploy workflow.
